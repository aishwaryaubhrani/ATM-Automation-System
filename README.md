# ATM-Automation-System
In this system when a person visits an ATM, it prompts a window for user to enter the PIN. After this, it takes the user to the money withdrawal or deposit page according to previous history of his ATM visits. If the user wants to change the option there is a functionality for that too. This way, the time is saved when we visit to the ATM.
